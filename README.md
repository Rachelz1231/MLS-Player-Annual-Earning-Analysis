# MLS Player Annual Earning Analysis
This repository is a project completed in STA302: Methods of Data Analysis I. 

In this project, I explored the relationship between annual earnings of MLS players and their performance, constructing a valuable linear regression model for the soccer market. This model helps soccer clubs accurately estimate a player's value and offers a roadmap for performance improvement to boost earnings.
